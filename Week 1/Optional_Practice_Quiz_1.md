# Optional Practice Quiz
## 1.If I miss an assignment deadline or fail an assignment,  I fail the  course.
### Answer False
#### Correct
#### No, you won't fail the course. But you should be familiar with how to deal with situations when you fall behind the suggested deadlines. See the How Grading and Being Late on Assignments Works reading in this lesson for details.

## 2.This is a completely self-paced course. The deadlines don't matter at all!
### Answer False
#### Correct
#### Deadlines still matter. For example, if you miss 2 consecutive deadlines, you will most probably have to switch to a new cohort/session. Otherwise, there won't be any students in this cohort/session that will be able to grade your late assignment.
#### However, missing deadlines does not lower your grade or make you fail the course.
#### In other words, if you miss a deadline, you just need to know what to do in order to continue. See the Grading reading for more details.

## 3.I can go through the course faster and complete it faster!
### Answer True
#### Correct
#### Yes, you can! If you want to go faster and finish faster, GO FOR IT! Just remember that you might have to wait for your assignments to be peer reviewed, but there will probably be others who finish faster, so you probably won't have to wait long.

## 4.Where can you get access to the example source code used in the course and the Lecture Slide PDFs?
### The link to the GitHub.com repository, which contains the example code used in this course, Lecture Slide PDFs, as well as assignment starter code is given to you in the first module under the title "ALL of the EXAMPLE SOURCE CODE for this Course".
#### Correct
